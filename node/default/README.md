# Basic Node app with Typescript

## Guide to files

- src folder
  contains all sources

- tsconfig.json  
  allowJs has been set to true. This allows easy mixing of typescript and javascript files.

- package.json  
  use build:live for watch
  
## TODO

- tests
- Dockerfile
- standardize targets (clean, compile, build etc)
- stop copying package-lock.json
